;;; Commentary:

;; Internal deletion support for removing persisted Codex threads by reaching
;; into the current CODEX_HOME storage layout.  This is intentionally isolated
;; from the rest of codex-ide because it depends on Codex implementation
;; details rather than a supported app-server API.

  "Delete Codex THREAD-ID from the active `CODEX_HOME`.

This command relies on current Codex internal storage details under
`CODEX_HOME`, specifically the persisted rollout files under the active and
archived session directories.  That makes it more fragile than the rest of
codex-ide, which primarily uses the public app-server API.  If Codex adds an
officially supported thread deletion API, this implementation should be
replaced to use that instead.

If a live session buffer is attached to THREAD-ID, prompt before tearing down
that session and then remove the persisted thread data from disk.

When SKIP-CONFIRMATION is non-nil, delete without prompting.  This is intended
for batch callers that already presented a single confirmation."
