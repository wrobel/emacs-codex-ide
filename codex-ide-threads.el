;;; codex-ide-threads.el --- Stored thread selection helpers for codex-ide -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026

;; Author: Duncan Gillis

;;; Commentary:

;; This module owns logic for presenting stored Codex threads to the user and
;; turning raw app-server thread metadata into completion candidates.
;;
;; Responsibilities kept here:
;;
;; - Formatting timestamps and previews for thread choices.
;; - Filtering thread lists for resume/continue flows.
;; - Building completion candidates and affixation metadata.
;; - Selecting the latest or an explicitly chosen thread.
;;
;; This code is intentionally separate from protocol transport and session
;; lifecycle.  The protocol module fetches raw thread data; the session module
;; decides when resume flows should happen; this module turns the raw data into
;; UI-level selection behavior.
